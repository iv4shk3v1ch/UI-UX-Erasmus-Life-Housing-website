# UI-UX-Erasmus-Life-Housing-website
During my internship, I worked on improving the website and internal operations tools at Erasmus Life Housing, a student housing platform in Lisbon.

## **Problem**
The website was hard to navigate and the UI was cluttered.

## **My Goals**

1. Improve homepage and main navigation UX
2. Simplify how users find housing listings
3. Develop an internal tool for managing apartment data

## **What I Did**

1. Audited the existing site layout and navigation structure
2. Redesigned the homepage (reduced clutter, clearer calls to action)
3. Cleaned up the main menu for a better mobile and desktop experience
4. Improved listing UI (map interaction, content structure)

## **Results**

1. Improved UX clarity (faster access to listings, cleaner layout)
2. Site was easier to maintain (fewer plugin issues, optimized listings)
